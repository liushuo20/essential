1. Code-for-obtainging-Sequence-composition-feature.py is the code for obtaining 4545 features from which 800 features achieve the top AUC being 0.8814 using 5-fold validation. Those 800 features are then used for further study.      
2. Code-for-obtaining-evolutionary-features.py is the code used to calculate ka and ks values, and ka/ks. The code mentioned requires align2yn00.py which is also provided.  
3. Gene-persistence-Feature.txt is the feature file containing the 17 binary features of persistence of each gene. The total numbers of genes is 10675, including 1513 essential genes and 9162 non-essential genes.   
4. Protein-protein-interaction-feature.py is used to calculate protein and protein interaction feature.   
5. Expression-feature.txt is the feature file containing expression values of 1513 essential genes and 9162 non-essential genes.   
6. GO-feature.txt is the feature file containing 130 GO annotations features of genes. 
7. Supplementary Table is the file containing the HGE(Human Gene Essentiality) scores of 18859 genes listed in the first sheet of this file, while the second sheet contains the distribution ratios of the HGE scores in specific ranges.
