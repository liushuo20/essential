1. Code-for-obtainging-Sequence-composition-feature.py is the code for obtaining 4545 features from which 800 features achieve the top AUC being 0.8814 using 5-fold validation. Those 800 features are then used for further study.      
2. Code-for-obtaining-evolutionary-features.py is the code used to calculate ka and ks values, and ka/ks. The code mentioned requires align2yn00.py which is also provided.  
3. Gene-persistence-Feature.txt is the feature file containing the 17 binary features of persistence of each gene. The total numbers of genes is 10675, including 1513 essential genes and 9162 non-essential genes.   
4. Protein-protein-interaction-feature.py is used to calculate protein and protein interaction feature.   
5. Expression-feature.txt is the feature file containing expression values of 1513 essential genes and 9162 non-essential genes.   
6. GO-feature.txt is the feature file containing 130 GO annotations features of genes.
